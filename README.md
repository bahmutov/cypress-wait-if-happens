# cypress-wait-if-happens ![cypress version](https://img.shields.io/badge/cypress-10.10.0-brightgreen) [![ci](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-wait-if-happens/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-wait-if-happens/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> A better `cy.wait` command

- ðŸŽ“ Covered in my [Cypress Network Testing Exercises course](https://cypress.tips/courses/network-testing)

- if the request happens, yields the intercept
- if the request does not happen within the timeout, yields `undefined`
- can yield the response body via the option `yieldResponseBody: true`
- can yield the last intercept via the option `lastCall: true`
- includes types in [src/index.d.ts](./src/index.d.ts)
- good to use in combination with the [cypress-if](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-if) plugin

```js
import 'cypress-wait-if-happens'
cy.waitIfHappens({
  alias: '@users',
  timeout: 100,
  lastCall: true,
  yieldResponseBody: true,
})
  // we should get the list with 4 users
  // because that is the last call that happens
  .should('have.length', 4)
```

## Install

Add this plugin as a dev dependency to your project

```bash
# if using NPM
$ npm i -D cypress-wait-if-happens
# if using Yarn
$ yarn add -D cypress-wait-if-happens
```

## Use

Import the plugin in your spec or support file

```js
import 'cypress-wait-if-happens'
```

### Wait for a network call

```js
// timeout is in milliseconds
// by default timeout is the current default command timeout
cy.waitIfHappens(alias, timeout)
```

The above command does NOT fail if the network call is not made within `timeout` ms. You can yield the intercept or `undefined` to the next command

```js
cy.waitIfHappens(alias, timeout).then((intercept) => {
  if (!intercept) {
    // the call has not happened
  } else {
    // the intercepted call, same as
    // the value yielded by cy.wait(alias)
  }
})
```

### Options object

```js
cy.waitIfHappens(alias, timeout)
// equivalent to using an options object
cy.waitIfHappens({ alias, timeout })
```

### Yield the response body

**Note:** requires using the options object

Because yielding the response body is so common, you can yield it (if the network call happens)

```js
cy.waitIfHappens({
  alias,
  timeout,
  yieldResponseBody: true,
}).then((body) => {
  if (body) {
    // there was a network call
    // and we intercepted it
  } else {
    // no network call made
  }
})
```

### Yield the last call

**Note:** requires using the options object

The command `cy.wait` takes each network call one by one. If you are not sure how many calls there are, it is hard to say how many times to call `cy.wait`. In this plugin, you can take all current calls that have happened and yield the last one

```js
cy.waitIfHappens({
  alias,
  timeout,
  lastCall: true,
}).then((intercept) => {
  if (intercept) {
    // we waited until a call was made
    // or if there were already multiple calls
    // we get the last intercept object
  } else {
    // no matching network call made at all
  }
})
```

Waiting for the last call automatically waits for all of them by calling `cy.wait` repeatedly. If there are no calls made yet, waits up to the `timeout` period.

## Using with cypress-if

This plugin works great in combination with the [cypress-if](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-if) plugin. See more examples in [if.cy.js](./cypress/e2e/if.cy.js)

```js
cy.waitIfHappens({
  alias: '@users',
  timeout: 2000,
  yieldResponseBody: true,
})
  .if()
  .its('length')
  .then((n) => {
    cy.log(`got ${n} users`)
  })
```

Tested with Cypress v10 and v9
